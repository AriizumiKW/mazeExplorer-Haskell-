# mazeExplorer(Haskell)
A maze automatically explorer, writed within Haskell.

This is my homework for haskell assignment.

How to play: W-Upward, A-Left, S-Downwards, D-right.

Input format of maze: examples have been given. 

How to make your own maze: I would recommend you use Randomly Prim Algorithm, which is not too difficult I think.  

Functional programming is so coooool!

DFS迷宫自动寻路，Haskell编写。

迷宫操作说明：w向前，a向左，s向后，d向右。  

输入迷宫的格式：文件里有，照着那个做就行。自己用一个随机Prim算法生成一个迷宫也不难。

函数式编程真好玩
